Hey, allðŸ‘‹

+ I am LYU Chengshang, a PhD student majoring in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at City University of Hong Kong.

+ I am a member of [CompbioClub](https://compbio.club) directed by [Prof. CHEN Lingxi](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/bms/profile/lingxichen.htm).

+ I received my B.Eng. in Information Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University and M.Eng. in Bioinformatics from CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science supervised by [Prof. LIU Xiaoping](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~liuxp) and [Prof. CHEN Luonan](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0012240).

+ My research interest mainly includes multi-omics integration, single-cell&spatial transcriptome analysis, Dynamic Network Biomarker (DNB), Sample Specific Network (SSN) and Gene Regulatory Network (GRN).

+ Also, I am a open-source enthusiast and there are some useful projects in my [GitHub](https://github.com/lllvcs).

+ ðŸ˜€ If you have any issues or want to discuss with me, please feel free to contact me via Email ```echo mwdt@pvumppl.mw  | tr '[b-{]' '[a-z]'``` or WeChat ```echo bHZjaGVuZ3NoYW5n | base64 -d```.
